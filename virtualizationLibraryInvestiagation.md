these three libraries seemed suitable to me for implementing
a virtual carousel with infinite scroll.

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-horizontal-scrolling-menu
- https://virtuoso.dev
- https://tanstack.com/virtual

I settled on tanstack with its virtual because it also provides
a system for managing the state of requests and data caching.
